# Castoro (Beta)
### Enhanced Media Caster

> [!WARNING]  
> DISCLAIMER: This project is not associated with Jellyfin project in any way. This project does not provide pirated content in any way.

---

Castoro is open source software that takes advantage of Jellyfin's fantastic Media System and adds features so you can use it to its full potential. Castoro is not a direct fork of Jellyfin and is fully utilized in its “original” state, it is enhanced by taking advantage of the software's API, this allows you to always have the latest updated version of Jellyfin and use all its basic features. Castoro does not contain any source code from Jellyfin or other libraries used.

## Installation

### Supported Architectures

Simply pulling `nscrio/castoro:latest` should retrieve the correct image for your arch, but you can also pull specific arch images via tags.

The architectures supported by this image are:

| x86-64 | ✅ | amd64-\<version tag\> |
| arm64 | ✅ | arm64v8-\<version tag\> |
| armhf | ❌ | |

docker run --name Castoro -e PUID=1000 -e GUID=1000 -e TZ=Europe/Rome -v ./data:/data -p 8096:8096 -d nscrio/castoro:latest
```

### Install with docker-compose (recommended)

```

```

## Application Setup

Webui can be found at `http://<your-ip>:8096`

More information can be found on the official Jellyfin documentation [here](https://jellyfin.org/docs/).

## Features

By default, Jellyfin allows you to manually add media content to the library for convenient viewing. Unfortunately, this system can be limiting in some cases, which is why we have added features that can come in handy:

- **Online search for media content** (currently only video, such as Movies and TV Series), using the TMDB API and the catalogs in the Addons. This allows you to automatically create the folders and subfolders needed for Jellyfin to be able to play content: NB: this does not in any way allow you to view in content if you do not have it, it is just an automation for folder structure.

- **Automatic content update** (currently only video, such as Movies and TV Series). Using the TMDB API and Addons catalogs, Castoro can update the folder structure in case of new releases such as the release of new seasons or episodes of TV series.

- **Playback via external url**, already supported by default by Jellyfin via .strm files, but here it has been made significantly easier to handle. It is possible to enter the link to be played directly in the metadata in the “Castoro Stream (Direct Url)” field, by doing this Castoro will know that it should automatically start the content from that url. This url supports dynamic parameters.

- **Addons**, are very similar to classic Jellyfin Plugins, but unlike the latter they are not used to extend functions to Jellyfin but to insert well-structured multimedia content predefined by Castoro. For example, it is possible to import a “Catalog” Addon to view content directly in Jellyfin that can be added to the library, or it is possible to signal to Jellyfin for that content which source it can be played from.

- **Discover**, that is a function that is shown from the moment there are Addons with catalogs, it allows you to explore these catalogs and find content that can be added to the library.

## Supported Clients

Basically all Jellyfin clients are supported, but not all of them fully support the features of Castoro. This is a list of the ones we recommend:

- **Jellyfin Official App**, supports all the additional features (search, discover etc.), it would seem to have some problems on Android.
- **VidHub**, supports almost all the additional features (search, discover etc.), works very well on all tested devices, is present almost everywhere.
- **Infuse** (Apple devices only), works as a normal Jellyfin client, much additional options of Castoro are not supported.
